# Cones-Detection
This repository contains two Python scripts for detecting orange cones using OpenCV and NumPy:
- One script processes a single image.
- Another script processes a video in real-time (frame by frame).

---

## File Structure

- **detect_cone_image.py**  
  Performs cone detection on a single image (`assets/test_image3.jpg`).

- **detect_cone_video.py**  
  Performs frame-by-frame detection of an orange cone in a video (`assets/test_video2.mp4`).

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all the necessary dependencies for running the scripts.
